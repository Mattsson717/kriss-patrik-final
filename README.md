# Final Project - Givers Game

Sprint six, it's time for our final projects. We're going to build one bigger application during these next four weeks (approx 20 hours/week).

# The Technical Requirements are:

Frontend in React (Redux optional)
Backend in Node.js
MongoDB database
Navigation using React Router
Should work in Chrome, Firefox & Safari
Be responsive and work well on mobile, tablet and phone

The application is called Givers Game and .

# The problem

Tech stack we've used are:

BE: node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Heroku, Postman
FE: React, React Router, React Redux, Redux Toolkit, Chakra UI, Netlify

We decided to take on a new challenges and played a bit with Chakra UI. It was also a challenge to connect all our mongoose models to each other and to use them correct in the redux store.

# Example for improvement:

- We want to filter tasks in the groups to show your own tasks, others tasks and untaken tasks.
- Create admins for the groups.
- Create task templates to choose from.
- Check tasks when completed.
- Deadlines & calender.
